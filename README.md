Information about mapping to published open schemas.

## Goals

1. Make Databrary compliant with open data schema standards, wherever possible.
    - NIH Common Data Elements (CDE)
    - DataCite
    - Schema.org
2. Support users who want to provide data compatible with these standards to do so in straightforward ways that enable self-curation.
