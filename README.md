Information about mapping to published open schemas.

## Goals

1. Make Databrary compliant with open data schema standards, wherever possible.
    - [NIH Common Data Elements (CDE)](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home)
    - [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)
    - [Schema.org](https://schema.org/)
    - [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
2. Support users who want to provide data compatible with these standards to do so in straightforward ways that enable self-curation.
3. Support linking data elements to specific, version-controlled, data schemas.
